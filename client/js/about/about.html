				Drawing on a deep knowledge of women&lsquo;s biology,<br />
				researchers at CHAUM identified a unique phase<br />
			</span>

			in women&lsquo;s internal rhythms that promotes external radiance, vitality and youth. Dubbed &ldquo;The Golden Phase&rdquo;, this period is defined by the cell division and differentiation that fosters bright, fresh and new skin. This singular discovery led to the development of a proprietary formula, the Cha-7 es complex&trade;, which activates the skin&lsquo;s own naturally occurring regeneration process to extend this Golden Phase continuously. By suspending skin in this optimal stage, the Cha-7 es complex&trade; doesn&lsquo;t fight aging&mdash;it preserves youth.
