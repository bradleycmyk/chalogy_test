				The Science
			</h2>

			<p>
				Drawing on a deep knowledge of reproductive and<br />
				regenerative medicine, Dr. Cha and his team at the<br />
				Cha Stem Cell Research Center identified a unique<br />
				phase in women's internal rhythm's that promotes<br />
				external radiance, vitality and youth. Dubbed "The<br />
				Golden Age," this phase is defined by the cell division<br />
				and differentiation that fosters bright, fresh new skin.<br />
				This singular discovery led to the development of a<br />
				proprietary formula, the CHA-7 Complex&trade;, which<br />
				activates the skin's own naturally occuring regeneration<br/>
				process to extend this Golden Age continuously. By<br />
				suspending skin in this optimal phase, the CHA-7<br />
				Complex doesn't fight aging&mdash;it preserves youth.
