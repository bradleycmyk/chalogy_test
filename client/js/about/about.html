				Drawing on a deep knowledge of women&rsquo;s biology,<br />
				researchers at CHAUM identified a unique phase<br />

			in women&rsquo;s internal rhythms that promotes external radiance, vitality and youth. Dubbed &ldquo;The Golden Phase&rdquo;, this period is defined by the cell division and differentiation that fosters bright, fresh and new skin. This singular discovery led to the development of a proprietary formula, the Cha-7 es complex<span class='entity'>&trade;</span>, which activates the skin&rsquo;s own naturally occurring regeneration process to extend this Golden Phase continuously. By suspending skin in this optimal stage, the Cha-7 es complex<span class='entity'>&trade;</span> doesn&rsquo;t fight aging&mdash;it preserves youth.
